RecipeApp
=======

**Developed by:[Prashanth Ramakrishnan](prashanth_r03@yahoo.co.in)**

**Features**
- Fetches the recipe details via the specified API endpoint and shows the recipe list in a recycler 
view, clicking on it launches the recipe details screen.
- Includes unit tests for presenters and instrumentation tests for the app flow.

Refer [here](https://gist.github.com/jemshit/767ab25a9670eb0083bafa65f8d786bb) for proguard rules.

**Note**
- Styling and animations are minimum, I used Android CardView to show the list and the details screen, everything is pretty straight-forward
- I decided not to use the Contentful SDK as learning to use the SDK was quite complex üßê and the documentation was not so explanatory, 
but I instead created my own model which did not take much time. ‚è≥
- There is no database in this application, data is shown as is from the API calls!
